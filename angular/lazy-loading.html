<div class="content" id="lazy-loading">
  <ul>
    <li>By default, Angular Modules are eagerly loaded.</li>
    <li>
      That means when the app loads, it loads all the Angular Modules, whether
      they are immediately necessary or not.
    </li>
    <li>This will not effect the smaller apps.</li>
    <li>But for large apps with lots of routes, consider lazy loading</li>
    <li>
      Lazy loading is a design pattern that loads Angular Modules as needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is a technique in Angular that allows us to load Angular Modules
      asynchronously when a specific route is activated.
    </li>
    <li>
      It improves the speed of the application load time by splitting the
      application into several bundles.
    </li>
  </ul>
