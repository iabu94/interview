<div class="content" id="ng-component-data-passing">
  <ul>
    <li>
      There are different ways to pass the data between components in different
      scenaios.
    </li>
    <li>
      If we have a Parent to Child relationship between our components we can
      Share the Data via Input
    </li>
    <li>
      If we have Child to Parent relationship we can Share Data via Output() and
      EventEmitter. Other than that we also can use ViewChild. It allows a one
      component to be injected into another, giving the parent access to its
      attributes and functions. In this case we need a lifecycle hook
      ngAfterViewInit()
    </li>
    <li>
      When we don't have a relationship between the components we can share the
      data with a Service. In this case Subjects are useful.
    </li>
    <li>
      Other than that we can use Resolvers and Activated route data to access
      the data when we do the routings.
    </li>
  </ul>
