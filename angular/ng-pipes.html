      We are using pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and
      other data for display.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pipes are simple functions that we can use in template expressions to
      accept an input value and return a transformed value.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pipes are useful because we can use them through our application, while
      only declaring each pipe once.
    </li>
    <li>
      For Eg: If we have a person object with the properties name, address and
      age. Now we need to display this object as json formatted in our template.
      For this purpose we can simply use the json pipe.
    </li>
  </ul>
