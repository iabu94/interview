      It's in MVC pattern
      <ul>
        <li>
          It will manage our components and also behaves like a pipeline to
          connect the components.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>
      It contains directives

          Using directives we can apply our own functionalities to the HTML.

        <li>
          We don't need to write our own MVC pipeline, we don't need to bind the

      Unit testing
      <ul>

          can measure the output and behavior.
