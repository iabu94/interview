  <ol>
    <li>
      Public <br />
      There are no restrictions on accessing public members. The type/member are
      accessible for all classes whether it is within the same assembly or
      another assembly that references it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Private <br />
      The type/member is only accessible within the same class. We cannot access
      those outside the class. This is the default access modifier type if no
      modifier is specified.
    </li>
    <li>
      Protected <br />
      The type/member is accessible within the class definition and any class
      that inherits from that class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Internal <br />
      The type/member can be accessed by any classes in the same assembly, but
      not from another assembly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Protected Internal <br />
      The type/member can be accessed by any classes in the current assembly in
      which it's declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Private Protected <br />
      The type/member can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by
      code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class.
