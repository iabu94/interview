  <ul>
    <li><b>Naming Conventions</b></li>
    <li>
      We should use Pascal case naming conventions in Class names, Method names
    </li>
    <li>We use Prefix “I” with Camel Casing to define interface</li>
    <li>Filename should match with class name i.e. Pascal name</li>
    <li>
      Member variables must be prefix with underscore (_ ) so that they can be
      identified by other local variables and constants
    </li>
    <li>Prefix Boolean variables with “is” or some</li>
    <li><b>Code Comments when we needed</b></li>
    <li>
      Avoid writing long functions. The typical function should have max 40-50
      lines of code. If method has more than 50 line of code, you must consider
      re-factoring into separate private methods.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don’t have number of classes in single file. Create a separate file for
      each class.
    </li>
    <li>
      The method name should have meaningful name so that it cannot mislead
      names.
    </li>
  </ul>
