      ViewBag vs ViewData vs TempData
      <ul>
        <li>
          ViewData and ViewBag are used for the same purpose of transfer data
          from controller to view.
        </li>
        <li>
          ViewData is a dictionary of objects and it is accessible by string as
          key. Eg: ViewBag["Employee"].
        </li>
        <li>ViewBag is able to set and get value dynamically</li>
        <li>
          TempData is stored data just like live session for short time.
          <br />
          TempData keeps data for the time of HTTP Request. <br />
          TempData helps us to transfer data between controllers or between
          actions.
