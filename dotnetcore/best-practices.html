  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Startup class and the service Configuration </b>
    </li>
    <li>
      The best practice is to keep the ConfigureServices method clean and
      readable. we can use extensions methods when we had to register a lot of
      services.
    </li>
    <li><b>Environment based setting</b></li>
    <li>
      Having a separate configuration for each environment is always good
      practice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Also after published our application we have to do update or fix some bugs
      according to requirements, then we have to do all of these things in the
      development environment. If we do this we don’t have to change settings in
      one file for each environment.
    </li>
    <li><b>Clean controllers</b></li>
    <li>Controllers should always be clean and readable.</li>
    <li>we shouldn’t place any business logic inside it.</li>
    <li>
      To avoid create business logic inside controllers, we can use repository
      pattern.
    </li>
    <li><b>Routing Naming</b></li>
    <li>
      We can use descriptive names for our actions, but for the
      routes/endpoints, we should use NOUNS and not VERBS.
    </li>
    <li><b>Avoid writing boilerplate code to map objects</b></li>
    <li>In this case we can use Automapper.</li>
  </ul>
