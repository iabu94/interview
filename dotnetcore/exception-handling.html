  <ul>
    <li>
      Exception handling is one of the most important features of any
      application.
    </li>
    <li>
      ASP.NET Core contains a middleware that makes exception handling easy.
    </li>
    <li>
      By default, ASP.NET Core returns a simple status code for any exception
      that occurs in an application. Middleware makes exeception handling very
      easy
    </li>
    <li>
      In our application we handled the exception using custom middleware.
    </li>
    <li>To do this, we created a class called ExceptionMiddleware.</li>
    <li>
      Inside the middleware we initialized RequestDelegate and ILogger for our
      ExceptionMiddleware
    </li>
    <li>
      Inside the invoke method we added a try catch block. Within try block we
      invoke the RequestDelegate with the current context
    </li>
    <li>
      Withing the catch block, we generate a GUID for the error. We log the eror
      with the unique GUID.
    </li>
    <li>
      And finaly we return the error response to the user with the JSON format.
    </li>
  </ul>
