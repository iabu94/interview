      Middleware is software that is injected into application pipeline to
      handle request and responses.
    </li>
    <li>
      They are just like a chain. Those are connected to each other and creates
      as a pipeline.
    </li>
    <li>
      When a request comes in it passes through this pipeline in the cnfigured
      order. And middleware will perform any action and pass to the next
      middleware. Same thing happens for responses also, but in reverse order.
    </li>
  </ul>
