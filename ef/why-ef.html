      SQL Injection: SQL syntax by providing some malicious inputs that are used
      in a query and in parameter names. To avoid this one, you should never
      combine user inputs with Entity SQL command text. Entity Framework is
      injection safe since it always generates parameterized SQL commands which
      help to protect our database against SQL Injection.
