      Ascentic was founded 2017 by two Swedes Anna and Patrick in Colombo, with the mission
      to help Swedish businesses find the IT competence they need while building
      the best workplace in Sri Lanka.
    </li>
    <li>
      And they have achieved it. Ascentic has recently been named one of the best workplaces
      in all of Asia, ranking 42 on the prestigious list and scoring a staggering 96% in the
      employee Trust.
    </li>
    <li>
      Apart from their main technologies of choice, they try out new stuff through their internal
      projects and Research and Development initiatives.
    </li>
    <li>
      They value their employees. They conduct technical sessions frequently inorder to keep update the
      knowledge of their employees.
    </li>
    <li>
      Through their new leave policy, where fathers are given the same amount of paid parental leave as mothers,
      and Ascentic pegged their employees' salaries to USD. And these are some of the evidence that they take care
      of the employees more.
