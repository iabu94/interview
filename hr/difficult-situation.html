  <ul>
    <li>Exaclty around 1 month ago I had to face the probem.</li>
    <li>
      I was creating a main feature of our Import Export application that was
      supposed to launch in two weeks
    </li>
    <li>
      One of our senior QA engineer found a major bug in the application and she
      wanted to push back on the deadline, which I knew the client wouldn’t
      appreciate.
    </li>
    <li>
      We understand the QA engineer push to move the deadline but I also knew the
      client has to have the application running on time.
    </li>
    <li>
      We didn’t want to push her and the team too hard but instead focused on
      finding out what they need that could help solve the situation.
    </li>
    <li>My team were also working hard to fix the other bugs.</li>
    <li>
      So, the TL talked with my team members to put some extra effort on weekends to
      get this done. And I agreed to that.
    </li>
    <li>
      And also we can not proceed further without the approvals of senior
      architects.
    </li>
    <li>
      And I gave some extra effort on weekends and managed to complete the bugs.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the end, the team understood the priorities and we were able to work
      together to direct resources where they were needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the end, we launched the phase 1 release of our application on time
    </li>
    <li>
      And also it caused to increase the client feedback on our team for the
      realease
    </li>
  </ul>
