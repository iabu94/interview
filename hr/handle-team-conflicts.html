    <li>There are always two sides to every story, which is why itâ€™s so important 
      to remain as neutral and open-minded as possible whenever we hear of conflict 
      between teammates.</li>
    <li>The first thing I do is identify the cause of the issue.</li>
    <li>Secondly, I try to bring the concerned parties together or contact them individually for a talk.</li>
    <li>My counseling skills come into play during the talk</li>
    <li>so the team can reach a peaceful solution</li>
