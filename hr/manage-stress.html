        While I find I do some of my best work under pressure, We know not everybody works that way 
        which is I will like to keep a close eye on how everyone on my team is doing.

    <li>If I start to notice stress or negativity within the team, I will try to tackle it quickly and proactively.</li>
    <li>Iâ€™ll talk with the individuals and assess the situation and see exactly how I can help alleviate it.</li>
