      As a software engineer, I’m passionate about creating truly productive,
      efficient products to make people’s experience with technology memorable.
    </li>
    <li>
      This probably isn't surprising coming from a software engineer, but I love
      experimenting with code.

      For example, when once I had to write a long letter in Tamil, I really hated and its a
      waste of time for memorizing or looking at a keyboard image related to each letters of Tamil Alphabetics.
    </li>
    <li>
      So I wanted to try to write my own system to convert tangligh to tamil which is more familiar
      for us. I had to teach myself the unicode pattern of all the letters and combinations.
    </li>
    <li>
      And finally I could come up with an excellent website to do that and I made it available for public.
    </li>
    <li>
      I really enjoyed the process of discovery and getting feedback from my collegues.
    </li>
    <li>
      It's exactly why I enjoy what I do all day as a software engineer.
