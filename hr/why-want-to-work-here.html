      I was thinking that this would be the best environment for me to apply
      the skills I acquired during my past jobs and Bechelors degree.
    </li>
    <li>
      So, I checked your careers page regularly and when I saw this job ad,

    <li>
      I thought it was finally time to try my hand.
    </li>
    <li>
      One of my friend also works in your company and he has praised this company
      for its excellent treatment of employees for years.
    </li>
    <li>
      I’m looking for a company that empowers and challenges its employees to be
      the best professionals they can.
    </li>
    <li>
      In addition, you have a great reputation for leadership in the industry.
    </li>
    <li>
      I really think I’m a good fit for the job and can grow even more in your workplace.
