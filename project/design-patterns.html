    <li><b>Unit Of Work Pattern</b></li>
    <li>
      If we use separate repositories for a single transaction can do partial
      updates.
    </li>
    <li>
      For example, If we have to update two different entity types as part of
      the same transaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      If each uses a separate database context instance, one might succeed and
      the other might fail.
    </li>
    <li>
      So that we have to ensure that all repositories use the same database
      context
    </li>
    <li><b>Repository Pattern</b></li>
    <li>
      The repository pattern creates the abstraction between database access and
      business logic.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instead of writing entire data access logic on the controller, itâ€™s better
      to write this logic in a different class called a repository.
    </li>
    <li>This will make our code more maintainable and understandable.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Singleton Pattern</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      he singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the
      instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when
      exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
    </li>
  </ul>
