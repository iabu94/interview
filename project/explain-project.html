  <ul>
    <li>I have done 3 project in my career at Virtusa.</li>
    <li>Among of them very effective one is Import And Export.</li>
    <li>
      It's project for the real estate software solutions provider company
      called MRI Software.
    </li>
    <li>We did this project from the scratch.</li>
    <li>
      MRI Software is also a software company that provides real estate and
      investment management softwares to their customers like real estate
      owners, investors, and etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Currently they planned to provide some extra facilities to their
      customers.
    </li>
    <li>
      The requirment was Import some data from once source and transform the
      data if needed and Export the data to another source.
    </li>
    <li>So full fill this requirment, we had to come up with this solution.</li>
    <li>The source can be a database or file or APIs</li>
    <li>
      Our phase 1 release focus on Extract a large amount of data from an API
      source and do the transform in ADF and Load the data into a csv file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Technologies
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are 4 main technologies we have used to develop this system.
          <ol>
            <li>ASP.NET Core - API</li>
            <li>Angular - Front End</li>
            <li>NgRx Data and RxState - State management in Angular</li>
            <li>Azure Data Factory - ETL tool.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          We chose ASP.NET Core for this because, this application needs to run
          across multiple platforms such as Windows and macOS. And also based on
          high performance and scalable system, we chose .NET Core for the API
          implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
          And from the client side we had a requirment to develop a single page
          application. So based on the current trending and Robust and easyness
          we chose Angular and for provide responsive performance we had to
          implement the NgRx/Data for the front-end state management.
        </li>
        <li>
          And for the ETL jobs, we did a POC on ADF and Talend technologies.
          Based on the performance on large amount of data and pricing and its
          easy to manage in cloud platform, we chose ADF as the ETL tool for
          this project.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      My Role
      <ul>
        <li>
          I was the only full stack developer in the project who can work on
          both UI and API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apart from the project user story works I also regularly used to check
          the unit test coverage and code smells on our project to deliver a
          quality product to the client.
        </li>
        <li>
          And also I used to provide some KT sessions also on UI to the newbies
          who recently joins our project.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
