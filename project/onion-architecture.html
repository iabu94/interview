      The main aim of onion-architecture is to address the challenges faced with
      other architectures and to provide a solution for common problems like
      tight coupling and loose coupling.
    </li>
    <li>
      The overall usage of the Onion Architecture is to keep the business logic,
      data access logic, and model in the middle of the application
      <br />
      and push the dependencies as far outward as possible means all coupling
      towards to center.
    </li>
    <li>
      Layers
      <ul>
        <li>Domain Entities Layer: used to create a table in the database.</li>
        <li>
          Repository Layer: acts as an abstract layer between the data access
          and business layer.
        </li>
        <li>Service Layer: the business logic for an entity.</li>
        <li>
          UI (Web/Unit Test) Layer: implementation of DI (Dependency Inversion)
          principle.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Advantages of Onion Architecture
      <ul>
        <li>
          Better maintainability as all the codes depend on layers or the
          center.
        </li>
        <li>
          Better testability as the unit test can be created for separate layers
          without an effect of other modules of the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          It develops a loosely coupled application as the outer layer of the
          application always communicates with the inner layer via interfaces.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Tight Coupling
      <ul>
        <li>
          When a class is dependent on a concrete dependency, it is called as
          tightly coupled to that class.
        </li>
        <li>A tightly coupled object is dependent on another object;</li>
        <li>
          That means changing one object in a tightly coupled application, can
          be requires changes to a number of other objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is not difficult when an application is small but in an
          enterprise-level application, it is too difficult to make the changes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Loose Coupling
      <ul>
        <li>
          It means two objects are independent and one object can use another
          object without being dependent on it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Goal of this is to reduce the interdependencies among components of a
          system
        </li>
        <li>
          And reducing the risk that changes in one component will require
          changes in any other component.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
