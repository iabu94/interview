  <ul>
    <li>
      SOLID belongs to 5 different types of principles we are using in project
      architecture
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>
      S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
      <ul>
        <li>
          Single Responsibility Principle says that "Every software module
          should have only one reason to change".
        </li>
        <li>
          This means that every class, in our code should have only one job to
          do.
        </li>
        <li>Everything in that class should be related to a single purpose.</li>
        <li>
          For Eg: If we have 2 requirements like to register the user and send
          email to the user. <br />
          In this case we will have 2 seperate services called UserService and
          EmailService.
          <br />
          Not everything in a single file
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      O: Open/Closed Principle
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Open/closed Principle means "A class is open for extension and
          closed for modification".
        </li>
        <li>
          "Open for extension" means, we need to design our classes, like a new
          functionality can be added only when new requirements are needed. (In
          C# we can use inheritance to do this)
        </li>
        <li>
          "Closed for modification" means we already developed a class and we
          have written unit testing. <br />
          We should not modify those classes until we find any bugs. (Default
          Repository, can accept any type of objects).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
