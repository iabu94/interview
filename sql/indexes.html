  <ul>
    <li>
      Index is a structure that remains in server table or view that can speed
      up retreive the rows.
    </li>
    <li>
      It contains keys built from one or more columns in the table or view.
    </li>
    <li>
      That enables SQL Server to find the rows associated with the key values
      quickly and efficiently.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clustered
      <ul>
        <li>
          Clustered indexes do the sorting and storing the data rows in the
          table or view based on their key values.
        </li>
        <li>
          There can be only one clustered index per table, because rows can only
          be stored in only one order.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Non-clustered
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nonclustered indexes contains the index key values and those each key
          values will be pointing to the data row that contains the key value.
        </li>
        <li>
          For Eg: If we have a large set of data in an Employee table with the
          details of Employee and Salaries.
          <br />
          We have a requirement to get the salaried employees between 50000 and
          60000. <br />
          So if we write a normal query, it will go through each row and compare
          the salaries.<br />
          But if we create an index on salary column, it will sort it out and it
          can be quickly retreive the data rows.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
