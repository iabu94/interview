        <li>A primary key is a column of table which uniquely identifies each row in that table.</li>
        <li>Unique keys also identifies an individual row uniquely in a table.</li>
        <li>But the difference is, Primary key will not accept NULL values but Unique key does. </li>
        <li>A table can have only one primary key, but more than one Unique keys.</li>
        <li>A Clustered index automatically created when a primary key is defined, but Unique key generates the
            non-clustered index.</li>
